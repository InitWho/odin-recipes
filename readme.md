Project: Recipes

This is a project designed to practice the HTML knowledge I have
acquired so far, and to practice git commits.

At the end of this project, I will summarize what I have learned.


In this project I learned:
    The basics of webpage creation using HTML, inclulding   - using headings (h1),(h2) etc
                                                            - using ordered and unordered lists (ol),(ul)(li)
                                                            - linking pages (a href'link location' link name/a)
                                                            - inserting pictures (img src='location')

Additionally, I have started using git to save my progress.
(git clone) downloads the remote repository from github
(git push) or (git push origin main) uploads commits from this pc to github
(git add .) adds files to be committed, with . representing everything in the current working directory
(git commit -m) commits files with a message to describe what I have done to make this current snapshot different

A source of confusion for me was forgetting that I need to push the commits for them to appear on github. I was committing them without realising that only saves them locally.
